Section 1: Configuration                                *MakeAsyncConfiguration*

The plugin is written in Lua and need to be activated with the following call: >

    require'make-async'.setup {}

Section 2: Usage                                                *MakeAsyncUsage*

This plugin is intended to improve the built-in `:make` command, which is
blocking the UI updates. The build command will run just like with `:make`,
populating the |quickfix| with the commands output. The output will be parsed
with |errorformat| to allow jumping between errors.

with |errorformat| to allow jumping between errors.

First define |'makeprg'|: >

    :set makeprg=./gradlew\ assemble
<
Then hit `<leader>mm` to kick off the build. The quickfix window will popup
automatically, displaying moving circular progress while the build command is
running. The output will be immediately displayed in the quickfix window.

Alternatively, the build can be started without |'makeprg'|: >

    :X ./gradlew assemble
<
To interrupt the build, press |CTRL-c| in the quickfix window.

Section 4: Mappings                                          *MakeAsyncMappings*

The following mappings are defined initially.

Section 5: Development                                    *MakeAsyncDevelopment*

- The plugin was extracted from my personal configuration, and may be not so
  configurable. It's supposed to be forked and code modified for personal
  experience. It's a script anyway.
